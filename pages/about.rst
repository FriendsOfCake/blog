About
=====

Friends Of Cake is a group of passionate CakePHP developers, working together to improve the CakePHP
community and produce high quality CakePHP plugins, articles and gatherings.

Community
---------

We want to help build an awesome CakePHP community. A community where people work together, unite their
efforts, help each other out and be all-round friendly supportive chaps and chappesses.

We want to create a community that helps promote and unite the CakePHP community, to everyone's benefit.

Plugins & Code
--------------

We want to create a "go to" place for high quality and `well maintained CakePHP plugins <http://github.com/FriendsOfCake>`_,
as well to contribute useful articles to complement the already excellent CakePHP documentation.

We aim to unite people around some central, common plugins and know-hows. Rather than having several forks
of a plugin, we want to merge them into one awesome plugin that everyone can contribute to.
